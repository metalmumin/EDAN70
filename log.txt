SNA(SuperNameAnalysis) now works for a single SM scope.
Next step is to implement for many SMs.

Now wish to implement for brackets.

Brackets done. A state machine is now inside {}.

Next step is to implement scope visibility. A state machine should
see the above declarations. Or be able to choose not to.

SNA improved to include getDeclarationList().
But this is in ASTNode, can this be changed somehow? 
		(SHOULD it be changed?...)

Added _declareBeforeUse. It's pretty poorly implemented and
should be improved. But it does the trick.

Next step is a bit more report writing I think.

There is now a long if-statement instead of a limited declaration
list. This is also poor since it has to check a lot of things every
time. Could be optimized to perform better.

Shadowing of local variables in scopes? All kind of shadowing.
